        South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the
        southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded to the south by 2,798
        kilometres (1,739 mi) of coastline that stretch along the South Atlantic
        and Indian Oceans;[14][15][16] to the north by the neighbouring
        countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and
        northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini and it surrounds the enclaved
        country of Lesotho.[17] It is the southernmost country on the mainland
        of the Old World, and the most populous country located entirely south
        of the equator. South Africa is a biodiversity hotspot, with unique
        biomes, plant and animal life. With over 60 million people, the country
        is the world's 23rd-most populous nation and covers an area of 1,221,037
        square kilometres (471,445 square miles). South Africa has three capital
        cities, with the executive, judicial and legislative branches of
        government based in Pretoria, Bloemfontein, and Cape Town respectively.
        The largest city is Johannesburg.


        About 80% of the population are Black South Africans.[16] The remaining
        population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (White
        South Africans), Asian (Indian South Africans and Chinese South
        Africans), and multiracial (Coloured South Africans) ancestry. South
        Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures,
        languages, and religions. Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the
        constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, the fourth-highest
        number in the world.[16] According to the 2011 census, the two most
        spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%) and Xhosa (16.0%).[8] The two
        next ones are of European origin: Afrikaans (13.5%) developed from Dutch
        and serves as the first language of most Coloured and White South
        Africans; English (9.6%) reflects the legacy of British colonialism and
        is commonly used in public and commercial life.South Africa, officially
