          Candy, and Loris did an amazing job on our NamKhan Project & Ecolodge
          property. For 2 weeks they were very professional, adapting to our
          booking schedule, weather conditions and staff presence. I would
          highly recommend the Candy and the King team as they were incredible,
          their work resulted in additional bookings, increased social media
          exposure and social media skills.
